# Molang

A dynamically intepreted language that enables rapid development and efficiency

## Features of Molang

1. C-like syntax
2. variable bindings
3. integers and booleans
4. arithmetic expressions
5. built-in functions
6. first-class and higher-order functions
7. closures
8. data structures such as string, array, hash and so on.

## Possible future features of Molang

These features were inspired of Typescript and Zig. These includes

[] add type hinting system for declarations
[] add struct and enum data structure
[] add support for generics
[] add support for pattern-matching (Zig-style)

## Main goals of Molang

I started Molang to strenthen my knowledge of Golang and learn about concepts in the design of programming languages such lexical analysis, parsing, syntax trees, the iinternal object system, evaluator, garbage collection, bytecode compilation and so on.
